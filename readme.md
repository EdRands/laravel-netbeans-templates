# DEPRECATED — Laravel File and Code Templates for NetBeans IDE

This project is no longer supported. I created it for my own use, but I have not used NetBeans for years. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my IDE of choice.

Since a few people have starred and watched this repo, I won't just outright remove it for now.

## Get your laravel coding done faster in NetBeans

I created these for my own use for the way I work. You may need to modify them for your own use.

I put them here for the benefit of others, and so I can find them if I move to another computer.

Please note that the code is not valid php/html/etc the way they are.
They contain FreeMarker code so NetBeans will intelligently fill things out based on input.

### Code Templates
The \code directory contains code templates.
Add them individually in Tools->Options->Editor->Code Templates

### File Templates
The \files directory contains templates for entire files
